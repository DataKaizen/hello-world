# hello-world
## I am learning how to use github
### I am learning how to become a remote data analyst with aspirations of becoming a remote Data Engineer

I am on an infinite quest of bettering myself. For the way I'm programmed, the best way to approach life is to gamify it. When I accomplish things, I think about gaining EXP and leveling up my character, which is me.

In video games, there are multiple traits such as intelligence, strength, charisma, wisdom. I can gain EXP in each of these categories and level myself up.
